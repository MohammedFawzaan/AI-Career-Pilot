• Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Clerk Authentication, and Neon DB; robust and modern.
• Enhances accessibility to high-quality career advice.
• Supports a scalable SaaS model for career development services.

EXISTING SYSTEM
Current career tools are largely fragmented and static. Most resume builders only offer formatting templates without content improvement suggestions. Cover letter generators often produce generic, robotic text that fails to pass ATS filters. While some platforms offer interview tips, they lack interactive, real-time practice sessions with personalized feedback. Most existing systems:
• Provide rigid templates without analyzing the specific job role.
• Lack integration between resume, cover letter, and interview prep.
• Do not offer conversational AI practice for interviews.
• Have limited ability to track user progress over time.
Additionally, comprehensive career coaching services are resource-heavy and financially inaccessible to many students and early-career professionals.

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
The proposed system is an all-in-one AI Career Coach that enhances job readiness through personalized, generative content and interactive practice. Unlike static template builders, it uses Google Gemini LLM API to dynamically analyze user profiles and job descriptions to create tailored assets.
Key features include:
• AI Resume Builder: Converts user data into ATS-friendly, professionally formatted resumes using Markdown and AI suggestions.
• Smart Cover Letter Generator: Analyzes the user's resume and target job description to write compelling, unique cover letters.
• Interactive Mock Interviews: Simulates real interview scenarios with AI-generated questions specific to the industry and role, providing instant feedback on answers.
• Performance Dashboard: Visualizes application progress and interview improvement over time.
• Secure Cloud Architecture: Uses Neon DB and Clerk for robust data management and authentication.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Job seekers often struggle to articulate their experiences effectively in resumes and cover letters, leading to rejection by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Furthermore, the lack of accessible, constructive feedback for interview preparation leaves candidates unprepared for high-stakes interactions. This project aims to develop an integrated AI Career Coach that automates document creation and provides simulation-based interview training to bridge the gap between candidate potential and employer expectations.

OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a full-stack AI-driven career coaching platform. By utilizing the Google Gemini API, the system will offer users the ability to generate ATS-optimized resumes and tailored cover letters instantly. Additionally, the platform aims to simulate realistic interview environments, providing real-time, constructive feedback on user responses. The ultimate goal is to empower users with a cohesive, accessible, and intelligent toolkit that enhances their employability and confidence in the job market.
