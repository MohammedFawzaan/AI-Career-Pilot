INTRODUCTION
• AI is transforming education by enabling personalized and adaptive learning.
• Traditional platforms rely on static content, limiting engagement and diversity support.
• Our project: AI-powered interactive learning platform with:
• Voice interaction
• Real-time question generation
• Personalized feedback
• Uses IBM Granite LLM APIs, LangChain, and Hugging Face for intelligent Q&A.
• Six core modules: Student Interface, Question Generation, Response Analysis, AI Tutor, Upskilling Module, 
Admin Dashboard
• Provides adaptive learning paths and continuous performance tracking.
• Built with Python, Streamlit, MongoDB/SupaBase; scalable and API-driven.
• Enhances accessibility and inclusive education.
• Supports scalable EdTech business via subscription model

EXISTING SYSTEM
Current e-learning platforms largely rely on static content such as pre-recorded videos, text-based materials, and 
quizzes. While some platforms use AI for recommendations or chatbots, they often lack real-time interaction and 
personalized adaptive learning. Most existing systems: 
• Provide generic questions without analyzing individual learning patterns.
• Use text-based feedback, which limits engagement. 
• Do not offer voice-based interaction or instant spoken explanations. 
• Have limited adaptive learning paths, failing to cater to diverse learners. 
Additionally, many solutions are resource heavy, requiring complex setup, and lack seamless API integration for 
scalable AI driven personalization

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
The proposed system is an AI-powered interactive learning platform that enhances engagement through voice 
interaction, realtime question generation, and personalized feedback. Unlike static e-learning tools, it uses IBM 
Granite LLM APIs with LangChain and Hugging Face to dynamically create context-aware questions, analyze 
student responses, and provide instant spoken explanations. 
Key features include: 
• Voice-based interaction for a humanlike learning experience. 
• Adaptive question generation tailored to individual learning levels. 
• Real-time response analysis with instant AI-driven feedback. 
• Upskilling module that suggests targeted improvement areas. 
• Teacher/Admin dashboard for monitoring progress and managing content

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Traditional learning systems often lack personalized interaction and adaptive feedback, leading 
to reduced student engagement and comprehension. This project aims to develop a voice-based 
intelligent tutoring system that generates real-time questions, evaluates answers, and provides 
dynamic feedback to enhance learning outcomes.

OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an AI-powered interactive 
learning platform that enhances student engagement through voice-based interactions and real-time 
question generation. By leveraging APIs, large language models (LLMs), and intelligent response 
analysis, the system aims to simulate a human-like tutor that adapts to each learner's pace, style, and 
performance. The platform will offer instant spoken feedback, personalized upskilling 
recommendations, and detailed progress tracking — ultimately promoting deeper understanding, 
inclusivity, and accessibility in education across diverse learning environments.

CONCLUSION
The proposed AI-powered learning platform transforms traditional e-learning by integrating voice 
interaction, real-time question generation, and personalized AI driven feedback. Using IBM Granite LLM APIs, 
LangChain, and Hugging Face, it creates a dynamic and adaptive learning experience tailored to individual 
student needs. The modular design—featuring student and teacher dashboards, response analysis, and upskilling 
modules—ensures seamless scalability and easy integration with other EdTech solutions. Beyond enhancing 
engagement and understanding, the platform promotes inclusive education, making personalized learning 
accessible to rural and diverse learners. With its API-driven architecture and subscription-based model, it also 
opens sustainable business opportunities in the EdTech space. By combining advanced AI with a user-friendly 
interface, this platform redefines how learners interact with educational content, improving outcomes and 
fostering continuous growth
